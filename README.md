# Video-Compressor

Creative ( and sub-optimal) hack to compress videos using SVD, inspired by CS506 taught by Lance Galletti.

## Features to Implement

#### Lossless Compression - Reversible compression (JPEG methods etc.)
#### Lossy Compression - Irreversible compression (SVD etc.)
#### Efficient Storage - Consistent and optimal storage for images/videos

## Requirements

Python 3

NumPy

OpenCV

Pillow

## Future Plans

React Frontend

Django Backend

Platform supporting Video Codec (compress/decompress) 

Optimizations: video compression algorithms, parallel batch processing, etc.
