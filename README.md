# Video-Compressor

Creative ( and sub-optimal) hack to compress videos using SVD, inspired by CS506 taught by Lance Galletti.

## Features to Implement

**SVD Compression: ** Utilizes SVD to compress individual frames of the video.
**Lossless Compression: ** Aims to achieve compression with minimal loss of visual quality.
**Efficient Storage: ** Reduces the size of video files for efficient storage and transmission.

## Requirements

Python 3
NumPy
OpenCV

## Future Plans

React Frontend
Django Backend

Platform supporting Video Codec (compress/decompress) 

Optimizations: video compression algorithms, parallel batch processing, etc.
